## 🎯 Important Notes

### ⚠️ Before Pushing

**VERIFY** these files are NOT in your git:

\`\`\`bash
# Check what will be committed
git status

# Make sure these are NOT listed:
# ❌ .env files
# ❌ firebase-adminsdk-*.json files
# ❌ node_modules/
# ❌ dist/ or build/
\`\`\`

If you see any sensitive files:

\`\`\`bash
# Remove from git (but keep local file)
git rm --cached <filename>

# Add to .gitignore
echo "<filename>" >> .gitignore

# Commit the change
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Update .gitignore"
\`\`\`

### 🔑 Security

Your Firebase Admin SDK file is currently in the root:
- `fueloptimiser-firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc-769de40f68.json`

**This is already in .gitignore**, so it won't be pushed. ✅

If you ever need to rotate credentials:
1. Go to Firebase Console → Project Settings → Service Accounts
2. Generate new private key
3. Update backend/.env with new credentials

- **Languages**: JavaScript (React + Node.js), CSS, HTML
- **Size**: ~2-3 MB (without node_modules)
