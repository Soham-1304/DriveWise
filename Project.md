One-line restatement
Build a fuel/energy consumption optimizer: a hosted web/mobile app that logs trips (manual/GPS/OBD/IoT), predicts usage, suggests efficient routes & charging/fueling strategy, improves driver behaviour, stores telemetry in MongoDB/Firebase, implements DSA-based optimization algorithms, and evolves into an IoT/B2B SaaS product for car OEMs, EV fleets, and ride-hailing platforms.
Big-picture architecture options
1. Firebase frontend + MongoDB Atlas backend (recommended hybrid)
Frontend on Firebase Hosting (React/Flutter web).
Authentication via Firebase Auth.
Backend serverless logic (Firebase Cloud Functions → Node.js) connected to MongoDB Atlas.
Why: Firebase = fast hosting, auth, notifications. MongoDB = analytics pipelines, aggregations, fleet-scale telemetry.
2. Firestore-first (all Firebase)
Simpler for realtime updates, chat-like dashboards.
Limitation: weaker analytics compared to MongoDB for fleet-scale.
3. MongoDB Realm + Atlas (Mongo-first)
Good for heavy telemetry, real-time IoT triggers, offline sync.
Firebase can still host frontend for fast deployment.

DSA & algorithms
Fuel/energy-efficient shortest path (Dijkstra / A* with cost function = fuel/energy used).
Complexity: O(E + V log V).
Refuel/Recharge stop optimization (DP/greedy hybrid).
State: (location, fuel/charge left).
Goal: reach destination at min cost/detour.
Smoothing noisy IoT signals (Kalman filter, sliding window).
Consumption prediction (regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
Clustering (K-means, DBSCAN) to find common driver patterns / route clusters.
Anomaly detection (statistical thresholds, isolation forest).
Streaming aggregation (sliding windows, heaps) for real-time fleet dashboards.
Backend & implementation
Language: Node.js (best for Firebase Cloud Functions + MongoDB).
Map APIs: OpenStreetMap (OSRM, GraphHopper), Google Directions if budget allows.
Compute split: Real-time (Firebase Functions) vs batch (MongoDB Aggregation / Spark jobs).
Caching: memoize routes, store precomputed metrics for dashboards.
IoT Integration: vehicles send telemetry → MQTT broker → pipeline → MongoDB.
Metrics & evaluation
% fuel/energy saved.
Cost per km saved.
Driver efficiency score improvement.
Fleet utilization (idle vs active).

Narrative for SEM Project
Our SEM project is a Fuel/Energy Consumption Optimizer built on Firebase (hosting, auth) + MongoDB Atlas (data + analytics).
On the tech side, we implement DSA algorithms like A* for route optimization, DP for recharge stops, and regression models for consumption prediction.
On the business side, while the MVP validates consumer use cases, our strategic pivot is towards IoT-first integrations with OEMs and SaaS offerings for fleet operators (Uber, Ola, logistics). This leverages the EV boom and makes the product scalable, defensible, and high-value compared to a crowded D2C market.
